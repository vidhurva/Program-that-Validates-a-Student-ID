// Hello fellow Programmer or internet streamer!
// I have created the following C++ program to validate a student ID Number 
// The char function is used to ensure that the user inputs the correct number of characters.
// The bool function ensures whether user input satisfies the user input. 
// I used while, if and for loops with switch and case statements. 
// Each case corresponds with each character the user inputs. 
// For example, if the user's 2nd character is not a "-", then the program is incorrect.
